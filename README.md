# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:
In this module we explored and implemented neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python.
# Resources: 
- Data Source: charity_data, AlphabetSoupCharity, AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimzation
- Software: Jupyter Notebook.
# Results:
## Data Preprocessing
- Target Variables
- Features for Model Variable
- Variables that are neither targets nor features that should be removed

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons were selected and why
- Achieved the target model?

No I did not on the first attempt.
- Steps to try and increase nodel performance

I tried two more attempts increasing the nodes so as to increase model perfomance.

# Summary: 
By the end of the module we were able to:
- Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
- Describe the perceptron model and its components
- Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
- Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
- Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
- Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
- Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
- Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.
