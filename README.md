# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:
In this module we explored and implemented neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python.
# Resources: 
- Data Source: charity_data, AlphabetSoupCharity, AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimzation
- Software: Jupyter Notebook.
# Results:
## Data Preprocessing
- Target Variables
- Features for Model Variable
- Variables that are neither targets nor features that should be removed

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons were selected and why
- Achieved the target model?: No I did not on the first attempt.
Attempt1:

- Steps to try and increase nodel performance: I tried two more attempts increasing the nodes so as to increase model perfomance.
